# RDF
RDF for two dimension structure
First, I create a 10x10 lattice and record the coordinate of every atom which I save in the "Atom" class. 
Then, I set the cut-off distance as 10 and dr as 0.1 so that I have a list with shape of 1x100.
Finally, in order to make sure there is nothing wrong with the code, I mark the target atom and plot every layer in the picture.
